      <h3>Jordan, officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is an Arab country in Western Asia, on the East Bank of
        the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and the east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to
        the north and Palestine to the west. The Dead Sea is located along its western borders and the
        country has a 26-kilometre (16 mi) coastline on the Red Sea in its extreme south-west.[8] Jordan is
        strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe.[9] The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most
        populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre. </h3>
